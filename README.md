**Kauppa** is an open source set of microservices for creating and managing your own store-front. Comparable in features to _Magento_, _Shopify_, and _WooCommerce_, **Kauppa** builds on the similar concepts and pushes further with modern, scalable architecture, and extensibility. 

## Documentation

With a growing number of organizations using **Kauppa**, we're currently in the process of working closely with the community to add new features and improvements in regular updates. **Kauppa** has been built to work naturally with [Naamio](https://naamio.cloud/projects/naamio) to provide store-front extensions to **Naamio** web applications, but it can be used with any application platform. You can read more in the [official docs](https://naamio.cloud/projects/kauppa/manual).

The documentation covers the REST API, with an update underway to provide the Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS) API. These are provided on a language, by language, basis, and therefore will be provided iteratively as each language FaaS implementation is considered mature. Our priority is for JavaScript / npm support to pass the test first, and others to come later. 

We use Swift and Rust internally, and we're already looking at Go and Python as priority options.

## Licensing

**Kauppa** matches existing Naamio products by using the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), with specific clauses to protect the Naamio community and cloud infrastructure provisioning.
